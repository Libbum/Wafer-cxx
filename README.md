**Wa**ve**f**unction Solv**er**: a parallelized, 3D, Schrödinger equation solver.

Wa*f*er exploits a Wick-rotated time-dependent Schrödinger equation to solve for time-independent solutions in three dimensions.

Pulled from [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/quantumfdtd/) originally, and heavily modified for the needs of my PhD thesis. At the moment it's still quite a work in progress, but will be soon modified to be a general purpose utility.

If you use Wa*f*er in your research, please reference the following articles:
